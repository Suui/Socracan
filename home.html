                <p>There is no agenda and there are no speakers before the event starts. Proposals are presented during the event itself in the mornings, and voted by the participants right after. It’s a great opportunity to speak to and code with many like-minded and talented developers in an incredible venue by the beach.</p>

                <p>The retreat itself is free. The only thing you pay for is the hotel, meals and meeting rooms. We will be there for 48 hours to collaborate and share ideas. There will be hands-on coding sessions, sessions focused on discussion, interactive talks and lots more.</p>

				<p class="details">Official registrations may start soon as we are concluding things with the hotel. Stay tuned! By the way, if you plan on arriving to the hotel before Socrates, the rooms are actually blocked from the 3rd until the 9th April so you are safe :). However if you are coming with some family members that won't attend the conference for vacation before or after, you should arrange it with the hotel directly once the rooms become available.</p>
				<p class="details"><b>The number of attendees should be limited to 80</b>. We want to change the payment method this year and are working on it. As previously stated in the <a href="#venue">Venue section</a>, there are two hotels available, both are nearby, within a 3min walk from each other. The event takes place in the <b>NH Imperial Playa hotel</b>. The prices for the event are still subject to change, but should be near the following:</p>

      <p>
        As a free-to-attend gathering, our attendees don’t have to worry about huge conference costs. Unfortunately, the hotel and conference rooms themselves are not free. Your financial support makes a huge difference to the event and helps make sure SoCraTes Canaries open to everyone, not just those that can afford it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In exchange for financial backing, we offer the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            a mention during the opening and closing sessions of the conference
          </li>
          <li>
            your logo on our website
          </li>
          <li>
            mentions on social media channels
          </li>
          <li>
            your merchandise available to everyone at the conference
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, if you would like to discuss alternatives or extra privileges as part of your sponsorship, please let us know. We will be happy to work with you to come up with something that benefits everyone.
      </p>
