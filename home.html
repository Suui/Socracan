                <p>There is no agenda and there are no speakers before the event starts. Proposals are presented during the event itself in the mornings, and voted by the participants right after. It’s a great opportunity to speak to and code with many like-minded and talented developers in an incredible venue by the beach.</p>

                <p>The retreat itself is free. The only thing you pay for is the hotel, meals and meeting rooms. We will be there for 48 hours to collaborate and share ideas. There will be hands-on coding sessions, sessions focused on discussion, interactive talks and lots more.</p>

                <p>We will not only spend the days together but also the nights. And – believe it or not – programmers are a great company! There will be lots of opportunities to spend your time. Starting with simple chilling over hiking and biking, playing games, hanging around, talking, laughing…</p>

		<p>This year, once again, the conference rooms will be located in the <a href="https://www.google.es/maps/place/Hotel+NH+Imperial+Playa/@28.1486463,-15.4314489,18z/data=!4m21!1m15!4m14!1m6!1m2!1s0xc4095380b4e84f5:0x19c7dad290fed192!2sHotel+NH+Las+Palmas+Playa+Las+Canteras,+Calle+Prudencio+Morales,+41,+35009+Las+Palmas+de+Gran+Canaria,+Las+Palmas!2m2!1d-15.4306974!2d28.1490267!1m6!1m2!1s0x0:0x9dbca812ce57c97b!2sHotel+NH+Imperial+Playa!2m2!1d-15.430758!2d28.148439!3m4!1s0xc4095387ae51e8d:0x9dbca812ce57c97b!8m2!3d28.148439!4d-15.430758" target="_blank">NH Imperial Playa</a>, near the beach. We are addressing the food and Wi-Fi problems based on the previous year's feedback.</p>
    <p>Also, you cant stay at the <a href="https://www.google.es/maps/place/Hotel+NH+Las+Palmas+Playa+Las+Canteras/@28.1486463,-15.4314489,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x19c7dad290fed192!8m2!3d28.1490267!4d-15.4306975" target="_blank">NH Playa Las Canteras hotel</a>, in case you want a cheaper hotel or we ran out of rooms.</p>
    <p>Both hotels are closed to each other. You can get there from the airport by bus, taking <a href="http://www.globalsu.net/lineas/linea60.pdf" target="_blank">the bus 60 to Santa Catalina</a> and walk 15 minutes by the beach (or take a taxi if you wish). If you are planning to do tourism, you may consider renting a car since the public transportation in the city does not work as well as in other european cities.</p>
